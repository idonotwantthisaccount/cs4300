In this project I was using django to create a website that allows a user to pick a movie, a seat, and then enter their name to create a booking. The website is simple and provides the user the ability to do just that. The home page has a list of movies with descriptions. At the bottom is a button to show bookings that have already taken place. When a user picks a movie it will show them an option to pick an availble seat and then enter their name. Once they have confirmed their booking they get a confiramtion of the movie, the seat, and the time the booking was made.
